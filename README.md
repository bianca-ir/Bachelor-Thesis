# Bachelor_Thesis

This repository contains the code and resources for my final undergraduate thesis. The objective of this research was to investigate the performance of three popular machine learning models (SVM, RF, and CNN) in the context of image classification. The thesis focuses on evaluating the impact of different preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods, and hyperparameter tuning on the models' performance.
